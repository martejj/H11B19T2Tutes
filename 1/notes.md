## Now for programming examples

### What are some interesting features of the following program?

```c
// Author: Andrew Taylor (andrewt@unsw.edu.au)
// Date created: January 2018
// A very simple C propgram

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    
    printf("I love COMP1511\n");
    
    return 0;
}
```

</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

## Comments
## The ```#include <stdio.h>``` statement
## The ```printf()``` statement
## The ```\n```
## The return statement
## Whitespace and indentation

## A second program and intro to unix

What is an operating system?

What operating systems do your classmates run? The tute room? The CSE lab computers?

What are the differences between each of the various operating systems? What differences are there in their interfaces, and how do you interact with them?

What are some different ways in which you can interact with a computer?

What are the differences between graphical user interfaces and the command line? When might one be better than the other?

## Important notes before going to lab

* Select 'use default config'
* First thing you run should be 1511 setup
* This lab is not worth any marks
* Any questions about home computing ask one of the tutors
